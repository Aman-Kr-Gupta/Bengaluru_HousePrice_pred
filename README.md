# Bengaluru_HousePrice_pred
# Project Description:

## Objective:
The Bengaluru House Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices in the city of Bengaluru, India. This project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and the selection of the best regression model using techniques like Grid Search CV. The selected model is then deployed as a web application with a Python Flask backend and a user-friendly HTML/CSS/JavaScript client-side interface.

## Project Components:

### Data Collection:

Gather data on Bengaluru house prices, including features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more.
Ensure data quality by addressing missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies.
### Data Cleaning:

Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
Explore and visualize the dataset to gain insights into the data.
### Feature Engineering:

Create relevant features from the existing data, such as calculating the price per square foot or encoding categorical variables.
Feature scaling and normalization may be applied as needed.
### Model Selection:

Experiment with different regression models, including Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Tree Regression.
Utilize Grid Search CV to fine-tune hyperparameters and select the best-performing model.
### Model Training and Evaluation:

Train the selected model on the cleaned and engineered dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
### Model Deployment:

Save the trained model as a pickle file for future use.
Develop a Python Flask web server to serve as the backend for the house price prediction application.
### Web Application Development:

Create a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the client side.
Implement functionality for users to input house features and receive price predictions from the deployed model.
### Integration:

Integrate the Flask backend with the client-side interface to enable seamless communication between the user and the model.
### Testing:

Thoroughly test the web application to ensure it functions correctly, provides accurate predictions, and handles user inputs effectively.
### Deployment:

Host the web application on a server, making it accessible to users.
### Results:
Linear Regression was found to be the best-performing regression model for Bengaluru house price prediction based on the evaluation metrics. The model is accurate and provides reliable price predictions for users.

### Future Enhancements:

Implement additional features such as historical price trends, nearby amenities, and school ratings to improve prediction accuracy.
Explore more advanced machine learning techniques and models to further enhance the prediction accuracy.
### Conclusion:
The Bengaluru House Price Prediction project successfully developed a machine learning model for predicting house prices in Bengaluru. The web application provides a user-friendly interface for users to obtain accurate house price predictions, making it a valuable tool for both buyers and sellers in the Bengaluru real estate market.
